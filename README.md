## Welcome to Echo
***[Echo](https://echo-cord.herokuapp.com/)*** is a site that is made for the friends to talk with friends, being a clone of [Discord](https://discord.com/brand-new) it uses live messaging so that the users can chat real time.

#### Technologies: React, Redux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CSS3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The main goal of this full-stack project was to follow through with my mvp features, which include:

- Servers - be able to create servers so that users can invite other users
- Channels - users can create channels so that they can all message within the servers
- Live Chat - web sockets used to implement a live chat functionality
- Direct Messaging - users can setup a direct connection with another user for messaging

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

## Splash Page
This is the page the user will see the moment they arrive at the site and as a spash page it gives the user the ability to see what the site has to offer. In the navbar there is also the ability for the user to login or signup. As a non logged in user, the user has no access to anything that they click on will redirect them to the login modal where they have the option to login or signup. But as a logged in user you have the ability to gain all access to the site in the matter of selecting a server and messaging other users via direct message.

## The Server Create Modal
On this page the user has the option to create a new server and choose wether the server is going to be a public or a private server.
