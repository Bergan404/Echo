## Welcome to Echo
***[Echo](https://echo-cord.herokuapp.com/)*** is a site that is made for the friends to talk with friends, being a clone of [Discord](https://discord.com/brand-new) it uses live messaging so that the users can chat real time.

#### Technologies: React, Redux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, CSS3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The main goal of this full-stack project was to follow through with my mvp features, which include:

- Posts - be able to post products that a user owns and wants to sell
- Discussions - post discussions about topic that other users have the ability to give input
- Shopping Cart - input products into cart with real time price updating for user to checkout
- Reviews - be able to leave reviews on a certain product for users to decided if its a good purchase
- Replies - be able to reply to users dicussions and other users can reply to the users reply

In addition to the mvp features I was able to implement some of my bonus features:

- Search - users can search for specific products and specific discussions
- Profile - users can see all the posts and discussions that they have created and save shipping information

## Splash Page
This is the page the user will see the moment they arrive at the site and as a spash page it gives the user the ability to see what the site has to offer. In the navbar there is also the ability for the user to login or signup. As a non logged in user, the user has no access to anything that they click on will redirect them to the login page where they have the option to login or signup. But As a logged in user you have the ability to gain all access to the site in the matter of selecting a post or discussion or create something new.
